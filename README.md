#base - an RWD template

---

base is exactly what it sounds like, a simple base html template that gives a grid/layout that is great for responsive design. While it's not pure HTML5 and CSS3, it does provide a fairly decent mix of old and new tech.

##How to
Pull down the project, and start modding the index.html, styles.css/scss, and scripts.js file.

###Requirements
While not strickly required, the CSS has been developed in SASS, so download a processor (Scout is a good multi-platorm app) and get crackin'.
An IDE/Editor, I'm currently using Brackets (http://brackets.io), but you should use whatever you are comfortable with.

###Included files/libs
- Respond.js has been conditionally included for IE6-8 support
- A mix-in for vendor prefixing has been included in the styles.scss file (requires compass).
- jQuery 1.10.2 has also been referenced from code.jquery.com.
